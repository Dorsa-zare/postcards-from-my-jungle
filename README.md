This project explores generative AI as a creative tool to build a fictional lo-fi jungle populated by imagined creatures. The goal was to combine images, sound, and language generated by AI into a simple interactive webpage that feels like browsing postcards from a strange ecosystem.

For image generation, I trained a diffusion model using a subset of real animal images from the HuggingFace cats_vs_dogs dataset. I resized the images to 64×64 and applied light augmentation before training a UNet-based DDPM model in Google Colab. Training took several attempts due to runtime resets and debugging issues, but eventually I was able to generate 50 fictional animals by sampling from noise and running the denoising process. The results were imperfect and often abstract, but this unpredictability aligned well with the imagined jungle concept.

For sound, I used a pre-trained diffusion audio model to generate four creature vocalizations with different durations and tonal qualities. This step involved experimentation with prompts and several regenerations to obtain sounds that felt organic and slightly uncanny.

To create a fictional animal language, I used a transformer model with prompt engineering focused on soft phonetic syllables and repetition. I struggled with controlling output consistency, so I curated and refined the generated phrases to maintain a cohesive linguistic style while preserving their generative origin.

I also designed and implemented the webpage using HTML and CSS, which became an important creative component of the project. Using Codex-assisted coding was helpful for experimenting with layout, styling, and subtle animations, such as adding blinking cat-eye elements in the background. This allowed me to focus more on atmosphere and interaction while still learning front-end techniques.

Image quality could be improved through larger datasets, higher resolution training, and longer epochs, while audio quality could benefit from fine-tuning on animal vocal datasets. Overall, the project reflects both the creative potential and the practical challenges of working with lightweight generative pipelines under technical constraints.
